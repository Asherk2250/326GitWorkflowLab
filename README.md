# COMPSCI 326 Git Workflow Lab

## Lab Description

This project considers the topic of real-world collaboration workflows in git and GitHub for software development in agile teams. Components of collaboration workflows that will be touched upon include development branches, production branches, feature branches, pull requests, code reviews, and ticket tracking. While there are discrete workflows that teams follow, it is also important to emphasize that standard workflow definitions are completely up to the individual teams/companies. These standards are, in fact, most often altered to better fit the work environment at hand. The presented workflow components serve as a foundation for learning how to customize the optimal workflow for a development team.

## Intended learning outcomes (ILOs)

Students are expected to distinguish between different types of workflows for managing a git repository and know how to deal with merge conflicts. They will also learn how to communicate with other team members in a git setting to get changes implemented and pushed. Theyâ€™ll understand the importance of tests in ensuring the production branch is reliably functional.

## Tickets 

For each of these issues create a corresponding ticket in the Issues tab of the repository. Be sure to add the appropriate label, description and title.
